# Relectrify Docs

Sample of a method that we can use to deploy documentation-as-code. This method uses jupyter-book which allows us to easily deploy files such as .ipynb, .md. .rst, etc.

This method also allows us to setup a CI workflow that builds the code and generate static HTML every time a new version of the code is pushed. 

Check out the next page to see a sample output directly from a .ipynb file. ..
